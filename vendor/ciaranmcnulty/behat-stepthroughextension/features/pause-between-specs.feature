Feature: Pausing after specs
  In order to debug failing scenarios more easile
  As a developer
  I should be able to pause after each step in a spec

  Background:
    Given I have the configuration:
      """

        When I have a failing step
        Then I should have a skipped step
      """
    And I have the context:
